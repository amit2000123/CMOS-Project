# CMOS-Project
The project "1:2 demultiplexer" is a digital circuit design implemented using
Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The
demultiplexer is a combinational circuit that accepts a single input and directs it to
one of two possible outputs based on the value of the select input. The project aims
to design and implement a 1:2 demultiplexer using CMOS technology.
The design of the demultiplexer is based on the principles of Boolean algebra and
logic gates.
The project involves designing the circuit, simulating it using software tools, and
then implementing it using CMOS technology. The design process involves
selecting the appropriate components, sizing them, and connecting them in the
correct configuration. The simulation process involves verifying the functionality
of the circuit and identifying any errors or issues that need to be addressed before
implementation.
The implementation process involves fabricating the circuit using CMOS
technology, which involves depositing and patterning multiple layers of materials
on a silicon substrate. The fabricated circuit is then tested to verify its functionality
and performance.
The project aims to develop a better understanding of CMOS technology and
digital circuit design principles. It also serves as a practical application of the
theory learned in the classroom, allowing students to gain hands-on experience in
designing, simulating, and implementing digital circuits.
